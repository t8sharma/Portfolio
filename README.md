## Work Experience
**Research Associate-Data Scientist @ Black Basil Technologies (_April 2023 - Present_)**
- **Text to Speech**
- Developed end-to-end generative TTS system using GAN-AI architectures(Glow-TTS and Hifi-GAN) designed in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow built
  data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines, trained models, Fine-tune on AWS,and Optimized novel generative networks using the latest techniques 
  like denoising diffusion.
- Improved speech naturalness by 7% and model stability by constructing Python's modular linguistics analysis and normalization modules.
- Optimized novel text-to-speech networks in Python, Reduced speech distortions, and enhanced model stability and audio fidelity leading to 7%
  improvement in mean opinion score (MOS).
- **Conversational AI - KAIWA**
- Developed a conversational AI leveraging natural language processing, machine learning models (e.g. BERT, GPT), and dialog management techniques to 
  engage in contextual, human-like conversations.
- Implemented retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance output quality and extract information from external knowledge bases.
- Conducted thorough experimentation with various model sizes including 3B, 7B, 13B, 70B, etc., to identify optimal metrics and ensure accurate 
  outputs.
- Utilized state-of-the-art large language models such as Llama 2.
- Currently integrating voice AI into the Kaiwa chatbot, leveraging front-end speech inputs and speech recognition capabilities through backend 
  Python scripts for speech-to-text conversion.
- **Speech Emotion Detection**
- The speech emotion recognition model uses Python, and Transformer achieves 84% accuracy by optimizing audio feature extraction and hyperparameters.
- Robust data pipeline for 2500+ samples, librosa feature extraction, UI annotation.
- Published research. Leveraged Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and toolkits for cutting-edge Speech Processing, NLP.

**Data Scientist Intern @ Orangus India (_April 2022 - June 2022_)**
